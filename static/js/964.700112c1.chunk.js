I&#39;m majoring in Physics, but am trying to transfer to Computer Science, as I realised that is where my passions and talents lie. I&#39;ve grown up in Hong Kong all my life, and love the city with all my heart, this metropolis paradise shrouded by nature and mountains. Despite this, I believe that as my university life comes to an end - so shall my time in Hong Kong, and I plan to permanently move to the United Kingdom/Europe if I am fortunate enough to find work there.</p>\n<h1 id="work">Work</h1>\n<p>I have been incredibly fortunate to get access to some amazing opportunities here in Hong Kong, and I have two favourites that I&#39;d like to highlight.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>First, at The Hong Kong University&#39;s <a href="https://www.lsr.hku.hk/" title="Laboratory for Space Research">Laboratory for Space Research</a>. I initially joined the team as an intern over the summer of 2021 where I worked on an incredible project that to this day shocks me in the fact that I was allowed to contribute to it: the design and launch of a satellite. As a member of the MeV-regime CubeSat project who was experienced in Linux and scripting, in the summer of 2021 I worked to setup the departmental Linux computer that would run satellite simulations through the <a href="https://megalibtoolkit.com/home.html" title="MEGALib">MEGALib</a> library. I setup the computer with all the required libraries and spent the last month of my internship refining and running some simple simulations. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>After remaining available over the next year for system administration duties from time to time, I was invited back for a full-time paid role over the summer of 2022. Here, I continued work on the simulations and worked to automate the more advanced simulations the talented physicists at the department had produced. By writing bash and python scripts to improve the productivity thousand-fold, I am proud of the contributions I was able to make to such an out of this world (get it... because... space) project despite being by far the youngest on the team. </p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Next, through January 2022, I worked at <a href="https://www.bloomstandard.com/" title="Bloom Standard">Bloom Standard</a>. I joined the team originally as an &#39;Electrical Engineering&#39; Intern, but spent the whole time working more as a software engineering intern - I didn&#39;t even touch a circuit board until the last week of the internship! With the team at Bloom, I was working to develop the company&#39;s first working prototype of a portable, hand-held, user-driven ultrasound device. That was my last week though - tinkering with resistors, circuit boards, and silicon wafers to successfully create our first working prototype that was deplyed in a hospital in Mexico. It was absolutely incredible seeing a device I made with my own two hands being used in a hospital on the other side of the world.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>However, for the first few weeks of my internship - I was a software developer. For the backend of device, the team wanted to deploy a modified fork of an <a href="https://github.com/jannisborn/covid19_ultrasound/tree/master/pocovidnet" title="open source deep learning library">open source deep learning library</a>. I worked with a supercomputer array of Nvidia cards specialized for AI from <a href="https://hongkongai.org/" title="HK AI Labs">HK AI Labs</a>. On the team, I was responsible for setting up remote access through VNC and deploying the AI successfully to the machine. </p>\n<p><br />\nAt both these experiences I especially valued the fact that despite my young age and relative inexperience to everyone around me, my opinions, thoughts, and time were valued. Experiencing this, it is something I continue to look for in all my future opportunities.</p>\n<h1 id="tech">Tech</h1>\n<p>I daily drive a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 9 powered by an intel chip running Arch Linux (I swear, I don&#39;t feel any sense of overwhelming superiority for using Arch and only use it for the AUR). I actively configure my dotfiles which are available on my <a href="https://github.com/AdityaRoot/dotfiles">github</a>, but the general tl;dr is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My window manager alternates between qtile (configured in Python) and dwm (configured in C)</li>\n<li>My editor of choice is my heavily customized neovim (configured largely in Lua)</li>\n<li>My terminal is Kitty</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>I also have a windows desktop powered by a Ryzen chip and Nvidia graphics card for compatibility and convenience reasons.</p>\n<p>My keyboard is a HHKB Hybrid Type-S and I love it to bits but unfortunately has rendered me incapable of using any normal keyboard and now I need to carry it around with my laptop.</p>\n',p=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,u=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},((0,a.Z)(e),e));return(0,l.jsx)(o.rU,(0,i.Z)({},t))};t.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(h.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Aditya Mangla",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(o.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",p," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(s(),{source:d,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
